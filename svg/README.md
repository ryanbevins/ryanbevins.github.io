# Custom SVG Icons Folder

This folder is for storing custom SVG icons that can be used in your portfolio's skills section.

## How to Use

1. Place your SVG files in this folder.
2. In the admin panel, when adding or editing a skill, you can reference these icons by their path:
   - Example: `/svg/your-icon.svg`

## Tips for SVG Icons

- Keep SVG files small and optimized for better performance.
- You can use tools like [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/) to optimize your SVGs.
- For consistent styling, use SVGs that work well with the portfolio's color scheme.
- Icons should be designed to look good in small to medium sizes.

## Example Usage

1. Upload an SVG file named `react.svg` to this folder.
2. In the skill editor, enter `/svg/react.svg` in the "Custom SVG Icon Path" field.
3. The React SVG icon will now display in the skills section of your portfolio.

If you prefer using Font Awesome icons instead, leave the custom SVG icon field empty and use the appropriate Font Awesome class in the "Icon Class" field.
